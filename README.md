Building Data Analysis Models for the C150's

**Intro**

Hello! My name is Rasa Audejaitis and I am a coxswain for Columbia Lightweight Rowing. Thank you for coming to my GitHub to poke around. One of my endeavors on the team has been the continuation of the historical "C150 Data" projects. Each of these projects have been carried out by alumni of the team. Each of these projects have helped with various tasks that impact workout planning, selection processes, and recruitment. 

The last iteration of C150 Data was the creation of an interactive workout database, by Lucas Geiger and Max Amsterdam. This model pulled information from Training Peaks using an API to create an interface for atletes and coaches to monitor training efforts. One of the hopes from this project was the creation of a predictive model that would aid in selection and recruitment as Training Peaks does not have any predictive funtionality. 

Unfortunately, due to Covid, this project was put on pause. Since, Training Peaks has stopped issuing access to the API. 

I am coding the solution. 

Currently, I am aiming to pull workout files from a Google Drive to create a "pseudo Training Peaks" dataframe. Athletes are assigned a file that they are expected to regularly update with their training data (.FIT files). As they update these files, my code refreshes the database and keeps the preformance measures in a local database. 

**To Do's**

- Add Historical Dat (at minimum, as long as the current athletes have used Training Peaks and at most back to 2008 when NLP strarted coaching)
- Create predictive model to assist with selection and recruitings


Both of the above are monsterous endeavors, but I am excited to help the development of C150 both now and after my graduation!
